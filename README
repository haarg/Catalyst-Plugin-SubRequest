NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::SubRequest - Make subrequests to actions in Catalyst

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst 'SubRequest';

        $c->subreq('/test/foo/bar', { template => 'magic.tt' });

        $c->subreq(        {       path            => '/test/foo/bar',
                           body            => $body        },
                   {       template        => 'magic.tt'           });

DESCRIPTION
    Make subrequests to actions in Catalyst. Uses the catalyst dispatcher,
    so it will work like an external url call.

METHODS
    subreq [path as string or hash ref], [stash as hash ref], [parameters as
    hash ref]
    sub_request
        Takes a full path to a path you'd like to dispatch to. If the path
        is passed as a hash ref then it can include body, action, match and
        path. Any additional parameters are put into the stash.

SEE ALSO
    Catalyst.
